# Leetcode Problems on Concurrency

Yes, **LeetCode** has several problems that involve **multithreading** and **concurrency**, especially in the "Concurrency" category. While Python is not the primary language for concurrency problems (most are geared toward Java or C++), **Python is supported** and you can solve these problems using Pythonâ€™s `threading`, `multiprocessing`, or `asyncio` libraries.

### âœ… Popular LeetCode Concurrency/Threading Problems:

These are mostly **design problems** where you're asked to implement classes or functions that behave correctly under multithreading.

| Problem Name                                                                                        | Description                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [1114. Print in Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-in-order/)                               | Ensure that threads print in a specific order using synchronization.    |
| [1115. Print FooBar Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-foobar-alternately/)           | Alternate between printing `foo` and `bar` with two threads.            |
| [1116. Print Zero Even Odd](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-zero-even-odd/)                     | Coordinate three threads to print 0, even, and odd numbers in sequence. |
| [1195. Fizz Buzz Multithreaded](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz-multithreaded/)             | Implement FizzBuzz with multiple threads.                               |
| [1226. The Dining Philosophers](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-dining-philosophers/)             | Classic synchronization problem with shared resources (chopsticks).     |
| [1188. Design Bounded Blocking Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-bounded-blocking-queue/) | Implement a thread-safe queue with blocking behavior.                   |

### ðŸ’¡ Python Tips for Solving These:

* Use `threading.Thread`, `threading.Lock`, `threading.Semaphore`, `threading.Condition`
* For multiprocessing (though less common on LeetCode), use `multiprocessing.Process`, `Queue`, `Pipe`, etc.

Example of a Python `threading` setup:

```python
import threading

def task():
    print("Task executed")

thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

### ðŸ§ª Practice Multiprocessing Separately

LeetCode does not focus much on Pythonâ€™s `multiprocessing` module. For that, consider hands-on tasks or platforms like:

* **HackerRank â€“ Python (Advanced)**
* **RealPython tutorials**
* Build your own toy examples: e.g., parallel file downloads, CPU-bound tasks using `multiprocessing.Pool`.
